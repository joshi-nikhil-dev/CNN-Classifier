I have Simplified the dataset by creating an AgeFolderDataset class which automatically retrieves the image path and labels based on the folder names. One of the challenges that I faced was the risk of overfitting. Beacuse the dataset is not that huge and ore complex architectures might not be favourable. I even implemented Hyperparameter tuning. I used optuna to do this. I set 50 different scenarios for hyperparameter tuning so that I can get the best result which will be optmizied to this particular CNN. Initially when I had set the learning rate at 0.001 and batch size 64, I was getting MSE > 5. After I implemented it, I achieved a MSE of 3.85 which is a good result taking teh dataset size and the model simplicity into picture. Please do Ignore the plotly error as I did not have it installed on my system.

a. Model Architecture:
I have created a CNN with
3 Convolution layers
max pooling layer
2 fully connected layers
This is a very simple CNN and I tried to focus on the model's ability of feature extraction and tried to keep it simple so that model does not behave in an unpredictiable way.

b. Classification Accuracy:
-I have used Mean Absolute Error to evaluate the model's performance. I achieved MSE = 3.85 which I think is pretty decent considering the dataset size and the simplicty of the model.

c. What worked well:
-The model was able to learn well with a reasonable validation loss and mean absolute error. The training in the initial epochs was a bit rough, but nearing 80+ epoch, it started to stabilize which meant that the model was able to learn well and overfitting is also not the case here.

d. What did not work well:
-F1 score was not working well and did not show the data that we could see and then come to a conclusion where the model might be going wrong and could make changes in the model. 

e. Improvement Suggestions
- Increasing the size of Dataset
- Use Transfer Learning with CNNs like Resnet or YOLO
- Increase the complexity of the model which will help to learn the features in more detail which will increase the accuracy of the model.
